			<h1>Welcome to our website................</h1>
			
			<p>Graphic design is an extraordinary talent and skill set that experts work years to develop.
		 				And for those of us without that specific skill, we can reach out to designers to hire them firsthand or use third-party design tools that make graphic creation easy. The ability to create something out of nothing is an extraordinary one, especially when that something can become stunning visuals and engaging logos that can make a huge impact on your business.</p>

		  				<img class="img1" src="https://www.freepnglogos.com/uploads/photoshop-png-logo/photoshop-cc-splash-png-logo-3.png">
		  				<p>Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Inc. for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the industry standard not only in raster graphics editing, but in digital art as a whole. The software's name has thus become a generic trademark, leading to its usage as a verb (e.g. "to photoshop an image", "photoshopping", and "photoshop contest") although Adobe discourages such use.Photoshop can edit and compose raster images in multiple layers and supports masks, alpha compositing and several color models including RGB, CMYK, CIELAB, spot color, and duotone.</p> 	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop">Know more</a>
